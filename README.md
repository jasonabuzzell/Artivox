# ARTIVOX
A chatbot AI that allows for personal character creation and preferences, and comes with sample characters and dictionaries. The name of the chatbot is "Artitalk", which is part of a bundle of programs for speech generation and synthesis.

Unlike most chatbots, _Artitalk_ is built for conversation, which means that the character will keep track of subjects, using mood (imperative, interrogative, exclamatory, etc.) to distinguish the flow of conversation. This means that the characters will not only answer questions, but also ask their own questions for clarification or bring up new subjects of interest to keep the conversation alive.

This program is still in development! _Artitalk_ is built entirely on Python, and uses its own HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and NLP techniques to calculate the best response. There are currently four third party packages in use for this project, namely **pandas, statsmodels, sklearn and word2number**. There will be a _setup.py_ file to download these and save the user some time, but that is being added after the model is complete!

If you have any comments on things that could be done better, please don't hesitate to share!
