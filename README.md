# ARTIVOX
_Artivox_ is a bundle of tools made for the artificial reconstruction of the human voice. Currently, only _Artitalk_
is available, a chatbot AI. Unlike other chatbots, however, _Artitalk_ is capable of having the user converse with 
multiple chatbots at the same time, each with personalized characteristics and preferences! 

_Artitalk_ is an overhead UI for NLP packages such as _nltk_ and _pattern.text_. Through these packages, _Artitalk_
understands syntax and semantics, searching for patterns within parameters using ML (HMM). _Artitalk_ can run on
Python 3.6 to 3.10 (though the one instance match-case would have to be changed), and uses the following third party
modules: _nltk_, _pattern.text_, _pandas_, _statsmodel.api_, _text2emotion_, and _numpy_. 

**NOTE:** _Artitalk_ (and _Artivox_, for that matter) are still under development! _Artitalk_ will converse, but
the syntax will be incorrect and result in non-intellegible sentences. This will be patched soon.
